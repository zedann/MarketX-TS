```



**Design Patterns Used:**
- Repository pattern for data access
- Service layer for business logic
- Factory pattern for dependency injection

## Slide 4: Security Implementation (1.5 minutes)
**"We achieved 100% OWASP Top 10 compliance with enterprise-grade security."**

**Authentication & Access Control:**
```typescript
if (user.login_attempts >= 5) {
  await userModel.lockAccount(email, 30); 
  throw new AppError("Account locked", 423);
}
const token = jwt.sign(
  { id: user.id, iat: Date.now() },
  process.env.JWT_SECRET,
  { expiresIn: '7d', algorithm: 'HS256' }
);
```

**Security Measures by OWASP Category:**
- **A01 - Access Control:** Role-based permissions, session management
- **A02 - Cryptographic Failures:** bcrypt hashing, secure token generation
- **A03 - Injection:** Parameterized queries, input sanitization
- **A05 - Security Misconfiguration:** Helmet.js headers, CORS setup
- **A07 - Authentication Failures:** Account lockout, rate limiting

**Rate Limiting Strategy:**
- Login attempts: 5 per 15 minutes
- Password reset: 3 per hour
- Registration: 3 per hour per IP
- General API: 100 requests per 15 minutes

**File Upload Security:**
- Type validation (JPEG/PNG only)
- Size limits (10MB maximum)
- Malicious filename detection
- OCR processing for document verification

## Slide 5: Payment System & Financial Processing (1.5 minutes)
**"Built a complete financial ecosystem with Stripe integration and multi-payment support."**

**Payment Processing Pipeline:**
```typescript
const paymentIntent = await stripe.paymentIntents.create({
  amount: Math.round(amount * 100), 
  currency: 'egp',
  metadata: { userId, purpose: 'wallet_deposit' },
  payment_method_types: ['card']
});

const fees = calculateFees(amount, method);
const transaction = await createTransaction({
  user_id: userId,
  amount, fees,
  total_amount: amount + fees,
  method, status: 'pending'
});
```

**Payment Methods & Fee Structure:**
- **InstaPay:** 0% fees, instant processing
- **Vodafone Cash:** 1.5% fee, mobile wallet integration
