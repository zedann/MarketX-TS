1. **Email & Basic Info** - Email validation with uniqueness check
2. **Personal Details** - Name, phone, date of birth with validation
3. **Address Information** - Country of residence and nationality
4. **Identity Verification** - National ID upload with OCR processing
5. **Selfie Verification** - Face verification for identity matching
6. **Security Setup** - 6-digit PIN and password configuration
7. **Risk Assessment** - 5-criteria evaluation for investment profiling
8. **Final Verification** - Terms acceptance and email confirmation

**Advanced Security Features:**
```typescript
// Account lockout implementation
if (user.login_attempts >= 5) {
  await userModel.lockAccount(email, 30); // 30-minute lockout
  throw new AppError("Account locked - too many failed attempts", 423);
}

// JWT Token with enhanced security
const token = jwt.sign(
  { id: user.id, iat: Date.now() },
  process.env.JWT_SECRET,
  { expiresIn: '7d', algorithm: 'HS256' }
);
```

**Identity Verification:**
